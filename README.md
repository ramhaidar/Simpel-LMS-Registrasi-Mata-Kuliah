# Course Registration System

This project implements a **Course Registration System** using a doubly-linked list data structure in C++. It allows users to manage courses and student registrations efficiently. Features include adding and removing courses, registering students, managing quotas, and displaying registered students per course.

## Project Overview

The Course Registration System enables educational institutions to:

1. **Manage Course Details** (Course name, class section, student type, and quotas).
2. **Register Students** to available courses.
3. **Track Enrollments** with quotas and counts.
4. **Display Course Data** and registered student lists.
5. **Update and Delete Registrations**.

This system uses **doubly-linked lists** to manage both courses and their registered students efficiently.

---

## Features

1. **Add New Courses**  
   Users can add courses with specified attributes (name, class, quota, and student type).

2. **Remove Courses**  
   Courses can be deleted by specifying their name and class section.

3. **Register Students**  
   Students can register for courses with quota limits and validation checks.

4. **Update Registration**  
   Manage student-course relationships dynamically, with limits (max 3 courses per student).

5. **Display Data**

    - All courses with details (name, section, quota, current count).
    - Students registered in specific courses and sections.

6. **Quota Management**  
   Ensure quotas are respected during student registration.

7. **Finalization**  
   Option to finalize and clean up unutilized courses with no registered students.

## Data Structures

### Course List Structure

The system uses a doubly-linked list for courses, where each course points to:

1. **Next/Previous Course Nodes**
2. **List of Students** registered to the course.

```cpp
struct elmCourse {
    infotypeCourse info;      // Course details
    adrCourse next, prev;     // Pointers to next and previous courses
    adrStudent nextStudent;   // Head pointer to student list
};
```

### Student List Structure

Each course contains a linked list of students:

```cpp
struct elmStudent {
    infotypeStudent info;     // Student details
    adrStudent next, prev;    // Pointers to next and previous students
};
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/course-registration.git
```

### Step 2: Open the Project in Code::Blocks

The project is intended to be run using **Code::Blocks version 20.03** or higher.

1. Open **Code::Blocks**.
2. Go to the menu **File > Open**.
3. Select the project file with the **.cbp** extension (e.g., `courseRegistration.cbp`).
4. Build and run the project.

### Step 3: Follow Interactive Menu

The system offers a menu with the following options:

1. Add a new course
2. Remove a course
3. Register for courses
4. Remove course registration
5. Update student count for all courses
6. Display all available courses
7. Display students in a specific course and class
8. Display all courses and registered students
9. Search for a course with available quota
10. Search for a specific student in a course
11. Finalize course registration
12. Exit
